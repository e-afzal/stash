      '<p>Shincha is the first harvest of Japanese sencha green tea. Shin means <em>new</em> and cha means <em>tea</em>. This <em>new tea</em> is extremely fresh, sweet, and has a rich, concentrated flavor. The beautiful, bright green leaves produce a tea with a smooth, silky taste—no wonder Shincha green tea is highly sought after. Once it\'s sold out, it\'s really gone. And there won\'t be more of this super-fresh tea available until next year.</p>\n<ul></ul>\n<meta charset="utf-8">\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<p>Green tea</p>\n<h4>Steeping Instructions</h4>\n<p>1–3 minutes at 158–176 degrees Fahrenheit</p>\n<h4>Caffeinated</h4>\n<p>Yes</p>\n<h4>Cups to Grams</h4>\n<p>50 grams makes 20–25 cups</p>\n<!-- split -->\n<div style="text-align: start;"><br></div>\n<div style="text-align: right;"><img style="float: right;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0898/3392/files/3-Shincha-Facts_Stash-Tea_all_480x480.jpg?v=1589478537"></div>\n<h4><strong>From Fresh Tea Leaves to Tea</strong></h4>\n<p>Our Shincha was grown in Kagoshima, Japan, which is located at the southwestern tip of the island of Kyushu. We harvested at the end of April, so you know this tea is fresh. Each harvest is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Just as people collect different vintages of wine, each harvest of Shincha has a slightly different and special nuance to its flavor. <span data-mce-fragment="1" style="color: #26793a;"><strong data-mce-fragment="1"><a data-mce-fragment="1" href="https://www.stashtea.com/pages/japanese-shincha" title="Limited Availability: Japanese Shincha Green Tea | Stash Tea" style="color: #26793a;" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://www.stashtea.com/pages/japanese-shincha">Read more about our Shincha</a>.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><strong>How to Brew Shincha</strong></h4>\n<p>The methods for brewing Shincha are a little different than regular green teas. It is suggested to use significantly lower temperatures, in order to avoid harming or burning this type of green tea, 70 °C (158 °F) is the sweet spot for brewing, and no higher than 80 °C (176 °F).<br></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bring fresh water to a boil and let it sit and cool for a few minutes.</li>\n<li>Use the hot water to heat a small teapot, swirling it around the teapot and then emptying it.</li>\n<li>Measure the Shincha into the teapot, using one gram of tea for every 6 ounces of water.</li>\n<li>Add the hot water to the leaves and let them steep for no more than 3 minutes.</li>\n<li>Pour into small cups and sip slowly to savor the unique fragrance and flavor.</li>\n</ol>\nAnother favorite property of Shincha is the ability to resteep. Some people even prefer the second or third round of brewing, since each steep brings out noticeable differences in the flavor and aroma.\n<ul></ul>',

      '<p>The Irish like their tea brewed very strong. Our Super Irish Breakfast blend is truly "the espresso" of teas. This tea is delicious with milk and sugar, but lovers of brisk breakfast teas will drink it plain.</p>\n<p>Our Super Irish Breakfast is a more caffeinated version of the regular Irish Breakfast. While Irish Breakfast is usually blended with an Assam tea base, our Super Irish Breakfast has even more Assam, which makes the tea maltier, richer and more full-bodied.</p>\n<p>Assam is a district in northeastern India that lies on the Indian-Burmese border. It produces more black tea than any other area on earth, with the exception of a few places in China. Assam\'s tea gardens cover some four hundred thousand acres of verdant rolling plains on both sides of the mighty Brahmaputra River.</p>\n<p>The other black tea used in our Super Irish Breakfast blend is Ceylon. Ceylon-or its contemporary name Sri Lanka-is a beautiful tropical island that lies just twenty-two miles off the southern tip of India. Sri Lanka supplies about 25% of the world\'s tea. The nearly six hundred thousand acres of tea under cultivation provide well over half of the island\'s export earnings.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.stashtea.com/products/super-irish-breakfast-black-tea-bagged" title="Super Irish Breakfast Tea"><span color="#00b38f" style="color: #00b38f;">Shop our Super Irish Breakfast Black Tea in tea bags</span></a></p>\n<p><b>Ingredients</b><br>Blended black teas</p>\n<p><b>Steeping Instructions</b><br>3-5 minutes at 190-209 degrees Fahrenheit</p>\n<p><b>Caffeinated</b><br>Yes</p>\n<p><b>Cups to Grams</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>8 grams makes 3-4 cups</li>\n<li>100 grams makes 45-50 cups</li>\n<li>1 pound loose makes 180-200 cups</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- split -->\n<h2><span>*Staff Pick*</span></h2>\n<p>"My favorite is our Super Irish Breakfast.
