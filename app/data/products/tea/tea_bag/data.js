If you’re interested in turning this delicious blend into a dessert tea, just add some creamer and a little sweetener for a rich treat.|What is rooibos? Rooibos (say it like ROY-boss), or red tea is an indigenous herb of South Africa that is made from the fine needle-like leaves of the Aspalathus linearis plant. When the leaves are cut, bruised, and oxidized, they become a reddish-brown color, explaining why it was named rooibos or “red bush”. The outcome of the process leaves us with a smooth, gentle, earthy flavor that pairs easily with a variety of ingredients. This makes it an ideal base for many caffeine-free tisanes.`,

China Young Hyson green tea, spearmint and peppermint from Oregon, and freshly cut lemongrass are combined for a fragrant, refreshing, and aromatic Moroccan Mint green tea. It is a superb drink hot or iced. Try it Moroccan style, sweetened with sugar.|In the bazaars of Morocco in North Africa, tea is served on a "sinya" or three-legged tray, usually made of brass, plus a smaller tray that holds three boxes, one for green tea, one for mint, and one for sugar. The tea is prepared in a samovar which brews strong, highly concentrated tea. Then it is heavily sweetened with sugar and a touch of mint. The tea is then poured into a teapot (known as a Moroccan style pot) which is elongated rather than round with a longer spout. The tea is poured from this teapot held high in the air into small crystal glasses with brass handles. Moroccans enjoy the social ritual of making this sweet flavorful tea which goes well with their hearty lamb stew, couscous, nuts, and apricots.`,
