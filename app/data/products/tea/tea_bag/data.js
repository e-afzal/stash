      '<p>In our most humble opinion, the single best flavor in the world to pair with cinnamon tea is vanilla. There, we said it. But to give this classic combination a tas-tea twist, we added an earthy, light blend of rooibos and chamomile flowers as the base. <br><br>While spicy, warm cinnamon and sweet vanilla are the main players in this herbal tea, all the ingredients come together to give you something that tastes just like fall. If you‚Äôre interested in turning this delicious blend into a dessert tea, just add some creamer and a little sweetener for a rich treat. <br><br>What is rooibos? Rooibos (say it like ROY-boss), or red tea is an indigenous herb of South Africa that is made from the fine needle-like leaves of the <em>Aspalathus linearis</em> plant. When the leaves are cut, bruised, and oxidized, they become a reddish-brown color, explaining why it was named rooibos or ‚Äúred bush‚Äù. The outcome of the process leaves us with a smooth, gentle, earthy flavor that pairs easily with a variety of ingredients. This makes it an ideal base for many <span style="color: #75c044;"><a href="/collections/rooibos-tea" title="Rooibos Teas | Stash Tea" style="color: #75c044;">caffeine-free tisanes</a></span>.</p>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<p>Cinnamon, rooibos, chamomile, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor</p>\n<h4>Steeping Instructions</h4>\n<p>3-5 minutes at 190-209 degrees Fahrenheit</p>\n<h4>Caffeinated</h4>\n<p>No</p>\n<h4>Tea Bag Packaging</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>18 ct - 18 tea bags in a box</li>\n<li>Case¬†-¬†six¬†18 ct boxes</li>\n</ul>',

China Young Hyson green tea, spearmint and peppermint from Oregon, and freshly cut lemongrass are combined for a fragrant, refreshing, and aromatic Moroccan Mint green tea. It is a superb drink hot or iced. Try it Moroccan style, sweetened with sugar.</p>\n<p>In the bazaars of Morocco in North Africa, tea is served on a "sinya" or three-legged tray, usually made of brass, plus a smaller tray that holds three boxes, one for green tea, one for mint, and one for sugar. The tea is prepared in a samovar which brews strong, highly concentrated tea. Then it is heavily sweetened with sugar and a touch of mint. The tea is then poured into a teapot (known as a Moroccan style pot) which is elongated rather than round with a longer spout. The tea is poured from this teapot held high in the air into small crystal glasses with brass handles. Moroccans enjoy the social ritual of making this sweet flavorful tea which goes well with their hearty lamb stew, couscous, nuts, and apricots.</p>\n<p>Read about our <span style="color: #06b18e;"><strong><a href="https://www.stashtea.com/pages/mint-field-to-cup" target="_blank" title="Pacific Northwest Mint" style="color: #06b18e;" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span color="#00b38f">Pacific Northwest Mint</span></a></strong></span>.</p>\n<p><span style="color: #0bb693;"><strong><span color="#00b38f"><a href="https://www.stashtea.com/products/moroccan-mint-green-tea-loose" target="_blank" title="Moroccan Mint Green Loose Tea | Stash Tea" style="color: #0bb693;" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shop our Moroccan Mint Green Tea in loose leaf</a><a href="https://www.stashtea.com/products/moroccan-mint-green-tea-loose" title="Moroccan Mint Green Tea" style="color: #0bb693;">.</a></span></strong></span></p>\n<p><b>Ingredients</b><br>Green tea, spearmint, lemongrass, peppermint</p>\n<p><b>Steeping Instructions</b><br>1-3 minutes at 170-190 degrees Fahrenheit</p>\n<p><b>Caffeinated</b><br>Yes</p>\n<ul></ul>\n<p><b>Tea Bag Packaging</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>20 ct - 20 tea bags in a box</li>\n<li>Case - six 20 ct boxes</li>\n<li>30 ct - 30 tea bags in a box</li>\n<li>\n<p class="p1">Case - six 30 ct boxes¬†</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Recipes</h4>\n<p><strong><span style="color: #06b995;"><a href="https://www.stashtea.com/blogs/recipes/shaken-caramel-mint-tea-soda" target="_blank" title="Shaken Caramel Mint Tea Soda Recipe| Stash Tea" style="color: #06b995;" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaken Caramel Mint Tea Soda</a></span></strong></p>',
